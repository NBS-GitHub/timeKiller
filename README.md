The 'desktop-first-and-only' game made for fun with use of randomness in Java Script.

Click the bombs, before they explode. The time to disarm each bomb amounts to 3 seconds.


The uses of randomness:

- Waiting time for the next bomb (between 2s and 15s).

- The bombs appear in the random place of the board.

- The random initial bomb position â€“ i.e. the bomb may appear with its fuse turned to any direction.

- The random smile after disarming a bomb (drawn from 5 available options).

- The random bomb's explosion (drawn from 5 available options).

- If we save the kitten, we get a random amount of orens (between 1000 and 9999 orens).

- If IE takes over the device, you wait for the support for a random amount of days (between 50 and 365 days).
